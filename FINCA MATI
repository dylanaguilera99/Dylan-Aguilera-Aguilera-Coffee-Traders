Story behind finca Matilde

The tropical weather and climate conditions make Costa Rica the perfect place to cultivate the most drinkable liquid in the world after the water , the coffee. Located in the west valley of Costa Rica , up in the hills of Naranjo , Lourdes to be exact , its where this incredible farm develops amazing flavors. The farm is named after our grandmother Matilde Barrantes , the land was given to her by his dad more than a decade ago , now the farm is managed by the 3th generation. Dylan Aguilera and his dad Bernabe Aguilera have taken over this farm and now they planted more than 5 different variaties. The project on finca Matilde has started around 5 years ago.
